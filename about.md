Trellis is a [linked data](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) server. As a consequence, it is especially
well suited for storing Web resources that _connect_ to other data on the Web. The
[Linked Data Platform Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-primer/) is a good introduction to
these concepts.

Trellis is also part of a larger effort that aims to (re-)decentralize the Web, allowing
the creators of content to have true ownership over their data. Furthermore, Trellis is built
entirely on existing [Web standards](https://github.com/trellis-ldp/trellis/wiki/Web-Standards)
standards, so its interface is stable, predictable and well-understood.

## Semantic Web

The Linked Data Platform has its roots in the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web),
and Trellis is built on many of these underlying ideas.
As such, [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework)
plays a central role in how resources are represented. The Trellis project defines
its own [RDF vocabulary](https://www.trellisldp.org/ns/trellis), which is used in certain
HTTP interactions with the server software. In addition, a [DOAP file](https://www.trellisldp.org/doap.ttl)
describes the project itself.
