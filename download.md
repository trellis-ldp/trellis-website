Trellis is an enterprise-ready Linked Data server that makes it possible to build and publish linked data applications on the Web.
Installing Trellis is simple and straight-forward. The latest version is 0.16.1, released on September 29, 2020.

  * Source code for the [current version](https://github.com/trellis-ldp/trellis/releases/latest)

_Prerequisites_: before installing Trellis, be sure to have a Java 8 (or newer) runtime installed.

## Docker containers

Trellis is available as a container from Docker Hub and can be retrieved (for the triplestore
version) with:

    $ docker pull trellisldp/trellis-triplestore

or, for the PostgreSQL database version:

    $ docker pull trellisldp/trellis-postgresql

In addition, there is a container that includes support for a triplestore backend as well as various relational
database systems (H2, PostgreSQL, MariaDB/MySQL). This container tends not to be as performant:

    $ docker pull trellisldp/trellis

Additional Trellis-based docker containers can be found at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/trellisldp).
Information about configuring a [dockerized Trellis
server](https://github.com/trellis-ldp/trellis/wiki/Dockerized-Trellis) can be found on the project wiki.
