      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p property="doap:description schema:description dc:description">Trellis is a linked data server that can be used for storing large volumes of content, particularly in cases where that content is stored for years and decades.</p>

      <section property="schema:featureList">
        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p>
          Trellis has been built on components that already support horizontal scalability: Kafka, Zookeeper and Spark. While it is
          possible to run Trellis on a single machine, scaling out across a cluster is well-defined and supported. Trellis is
          "eventually consistent", meaning that many operations run asynchronously. While this makes the system very responsive, it
          also means that clients cannot expect operations to be atomic. In general, per-resource operations are atomic; operations
          that cause other resources to change are handled asynchronously.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section property="schema:featureList">
        <h3>Durability</h3>
        <p>
          Data integrity is vitally important for content that is stored for years and decades. Trellis makes it possible to retrieve
          the state of any resource at any, arbitrary point in time. This also means that nothing is ever truly deleted. For every
          operation that changes a resource, there is a full audit log available through standard LDP mechanisms.
          This audit log lists who made what change and when that change was made.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section property="schema:featureList">
        <h3>Modularity</h3>
        <p>
          The overall code base for Trellis is small, and it is divided up into even smaller modules each of which can be maintained
          independently. This simplifies maintenance and it also makes it easy to customize individual components as needed. Trellis
          has also been designed to fully support OSGi deployment.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section property="schema:featureList">
        <h3>Flexibility</h3>
        <p>
          Because Trellis is built on top of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-primer/">LDP</a>, clients that interact with it
          tend to use a lot of RDF (e.g. <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>). Trellis
          enforces only a very minimal set of restrictions on what RDF is allowable: basically, if LDP prohibits it, Trellis does not
          allow it; otherwise, pretty much anything goes. You can use any RDF vocabulary; you can store binaries of any type. Any
          special handling of particular content types needs to be handled in another layer of your software stack.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section property="schema:featureList">
        <h3>Web Standards</h3>
        <p>
          There are a lot of standards in existence. Trellis has selected to conform to a collection of well-defined and broadly used
          specifications because doing so provides a solid and well-understood foundation for interacting with the software. This also
          makes the Trellis API stable and consistent.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section property="schema:featureList">
        <h3>External Integrations</h3>
        <p>
          Any time a resource is created, modified or deleted, a notification is made available, making it easy to use an integration
          framework to connect Trellis to external applications. The notifications provide enough information to make informed routing
          decisions without being too heavy.
